# Buttons and Calculator Project

Welcome to my Buttons and Calculator project! In this project, I aimed to create a variety of buttons with different designs and functionalities, and integrate them into a simple calculator web application. Let me walk you through the process!

## Objective

The objective of this project was to create different button variations, focusing on both their design and functionality. I selected predefined button designs from the `button_options` folder and customized them using SASS to make them visually appealing and unique. Subsequently, I incorporated these buttons into a calculator web application, making it both functional and aesthetically pleasing.

## Instructions

To successfully complete the project, I followed these steps:

1. **Selection**: I decided on the complexity of the buttons I wanted to create, mixing and matching different levels of difficulty based on my comfort and expertise level.

2. **Source Buttons**: I selected at least 5 button designs from the `button_options` folder located within the `1-buttons` directory. These designs served as the foundation for my project.

3. **Customization**: I customized the selected button styles using SASS. Experimenting with colors, typography, and effects, I added my own touch to make the buttons unique.

4. **Implementation**: I incorporated the customized button styles into a calculator web application. Ensuring the application was both functional and visually appealing, it served as a standout piece in my portfolio.

5. **Portfolio Readiness**: I ensured that the calculator project reflected my capabilities as a web developer. Making the application user-friendly and well-designed, I demonstrated my proficiency in front-end development.

## Project Structure

The project was organized into the following directories:

- `1-buttons`: Contains the predefined button designs in the `button_options` folder.
- `2-calculator`: Includes the calculator web application where I implemented the button styles.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, I followed these steps:

1. Cloned the project repository to my local machine.
2. Navigated to the project directory.
3. Customized the button styles using SASS and implemented them into the calculator web application.
4. Tested the functionality and appearance of the calculator application.
5. Once satisfied, I pushed my changes to the repository and showcased my work!

## Conclusion

This project provided a valuable learning opportunity for me to explore button design and implementation in a practical context. It helped me improve my front-end development skills while creating a functional and visually appealing calculator application.
